# Needs

## Managing the Library

### N1: CRUD Operations on Library

Currently there is not an easy way to manage the DMR library. Songs must be manually added and checked into the repository. Users must manually edit the MP3 tags for the file in order to update the information. Deleting involves manually deleting files and then resyncing the repository.

### N2: Tracking Custom Information

Currently there is no way to keep track of custom information for the songs in the library (such as date added, popularity, number of plays, etc.).

### N3: Songs vs. Samples

There is no conceptual difference between a "song" and a "sound bite" or "sample" in the library. Any audio imported into the DMR library is imported as a song.

## Integrating with Other Programs

### N4: Generating Playlists

Currently, there is no easy way to automatically generate playlists for Mixxx. To create a playlist, Users must import all songs into Mixxx, drag them individually into the playlist, and then export. Users can use programs like [Kid3](https://kid3.sourceforge.io/), but the process is more difficult than it should be.

## General Ease of Use

### N5: Setup from Scratch

There is no easy way to set up the entire system from scratch on a new machine.
